# ICL_add_block Package

This package can read or predict (ML) the ICL and BCG classes for a given
stellar population in a main halo of a simulated cluster. After, it can add
this information as a new block to the snapshot file. The writing is general
enough so that these functions can be used to add any block to the snapshot,
not just ICL/BCG labels.
